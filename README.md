# PythonLib
 General library for python.  Below are the packages that make up this library.
 
##Base
  Is a low level library for some simple functions and classes. For details of each 
  module look under 'HelpFiles' and review the modules.
##Help
  Is a help system for command line programs.  Allows you to create your help in 
  simple text files.  In this way you do not have to modify the code to add help
  to the program and the help can be as much as you wish without bloating the 
  code with a bunch of strings.  For details of this system see details under 
  'HelpFiles' and review 'Help.py'
